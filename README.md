INTRODUCTION

The Return to Moria Server Manager (RTM Server Manager) is a standalone tool 
designed to simplify the setup and management of a dedicated Return to Moria server.

This application automatically sets up SteamCMD, installs the dedicated server, 
and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage server settings.

- **Graphical Interface** - No command-line needed; everything is handled via an easy-to-use UI.
- **Configuration Management** - Edit server settings through the app with tooltips explaining each option.
- **Live Terminal** - Start, stop, and send commands to the server from the GUI.
- **Auto Restart Scheduling** - Set hourly, daily, or weekly server restarts.
- **Notification System** - Enable **Discord webhooks** and **desktop notifications** for server events.
